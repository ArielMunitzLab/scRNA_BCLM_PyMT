CD45+ cells were isolated from the lungs of PyMT-injected WT and Î”dblGATA mice and processed using droplet-based scRNA technique. 

Raw data were received as fastq files and Scanpy library for python (v1.9.6) was used for analysing single-cell gene expression data. This analysis includes pre-processing, visualization, clustering, ORA, trajectory inference and differential expression testing.
